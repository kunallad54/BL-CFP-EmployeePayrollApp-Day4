# BL-CFP-EmployeePayrollApp-Day4

* Create a Employee Payroll Spring Project to cater to REST Request from Employee Payroll UI
  - Here we will reuse the Employee Payroll Frontend UI we have already developed
  - Instead of making REST call to JSONServer will now make server calls to Employee Payroll Spring App
  - Also test the REST API using CURL Commands

* Create a Rest Controller to demonstrate the various HTTP Methods
  - Before starting set application.properties to set properties of MySQL Driver and MySQL Credentials
  - Test the REST Calls using CURL.
  - At this stage the interest is to establish the connectivity and ensure data is transmitted in REST Calls
